### Dowhy causal impact estimation vax coverage on case incidence rate for differnt counties, <br>DTP-containing vac 3rd Dose

<br>
<p>DoWhy is a Python library for causal inference that allows modeling and testing of causal assumptions, based on a unified language for causal inference.
<strong>See the book <em>Models, Reasoning, and Inference</em> by Judea Pearl for deeper insights, that goes far beyond my horizon.</strong></p>

Interpretation of Causal Effect Estimation:

The causal effect estimation gives a numerical value indicating how much the outcome (reported cases) changes when the treatment (coverage) changes by one unit.

    Positive causal effect (e.g. 0.5): For each 1% increase in coverage, reported cases expected to increase by 0.5 cases per million.
    Negative causal effect (e.g. -0.5): For each 1% increase in vaccination coverage, reported cases are expected to decrease by 0.5 cases per million.
    Warning: the results were not checked for confounding factors or lack of causality neither methodological errors
